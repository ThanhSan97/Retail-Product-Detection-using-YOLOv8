# Retail-Product-Detection-using-YOLOv8
Building a system for product recognition and counting at the checkout counter in supermarkets using YOLOv8" was carried out by my team of 5 members at Duy Tan University. The result of the project is the development of a system that can recognize products at the checkout counter and count the quantity of each product.
